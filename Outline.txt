Here's 1 idea that takes 3 hours to do, but will be such a ðŸ”¥ bullet point.
Pick something you really like: Stardew Valley

Make a static site that:
  * Uses semantic HTML & flexbox
  * Be able to view this on any screen size
  * Shrink the browser window and it still looks good

Remember, Senior Devs care a hell of a lot more about the basics and going deeper into that than the new framework of the day!

Then, validate the HTML and CSS using W3C Markup Validation. Make the recommended changes. 

Finally, run a performance test using Google PageSpeed Insights. Look at the opportunities to increase performance. Record the metrics before and after you make the suggested changes.


You'll now have 3 ðŸ”¥ bullet points:

* Reduced largest contentful paint by X% from X seconds to X seconds by running web performance test to identify opportunities to speed up the application.
* Refactored for best practices by validating HTML and CSS using W3C Markup Validation Service.
* Optimized design for 8 screen sizes (desktop and mobile) using Responsively app, flexbox, and media queries.
